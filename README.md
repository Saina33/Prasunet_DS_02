# Prasunet_DS_02


Hi everyone,

Excited to share some insights from Task 2 of my internship at Prasunet Company! This time, the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle using Python to uncover hidden patterns and understand passenger survival rates.

Unveiling Survival Stories Through Cross-Tabulations:
My analysis focused on cross-tabulations, a technique that reveals relationships between variables. Here, I compared passenger survival (Survived/Died) with characteristics like gender (Sex) and social class (Passenger Class).

The Exploration Process:
Data Wrangling with pandas:  I utilized the powerful pandas library to import, clean, and analyze the data.
Missing Pieces, Filled In:  I addressed missing data points using imputation techniques.
Statistical Insights:  Statistical analysis helped identify key trends.
Visualizing the Story:  Bar charts brought the relationships between variables to life, highlighting patterns and trends.

Key Findings:

The data suggests women had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.
First Class passengers enjoyed the highest survival rate, regardless of gender.  only 3 women and 77 men from First Class didn't survive, compared to 89 female and 45 male survivors.
Survival rates and female survivors decreased steadily from First to Third Class, while male non-survivors increased. This implies social class significantly impacted survival chances.
The data reveals a staggering number of male non-survivors in Third Class (300). However, the number of female survivors (72) surprisingly matched the number of non-survivors (72) in the same class.
